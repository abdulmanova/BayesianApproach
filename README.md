# BayesianApproach
<p>The Bayesian approach in machine learning is a method based on Bayes’
Theorem. Bayes’ Theorem allows us to calculate posterior probability as a
product of prior probability and quotient of likelihood over marginal probability.
Marginal probability is a probability of the evidence under some circumstances.
Likelihood is a probability of the evidence given hypothesis and posterior
probability is probability after the evidence is considered. All in all, Bayes’
Rule calculates the probability of the hypothesis being true based on some
evidence. Therefore, this theorem can be applied to estimate the target value of
a machine learning problem in four steps: 1) link data to parameters, 2) collect
prior information about parameters, 3) combine data and prior using Bayes’
Theorem to obtain posterior distribution and 4) define parameters with the help
of posterior.</p>
<p>Bayesian machine learning will be useful if the dataset is not sufficiently
large but the prior knowledge is informative. In this case the posterior
distribution will be comparable to the prior. Moreover, the Bayesian approach
expresses some uncertainty through standard deviation</p>
